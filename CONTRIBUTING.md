# First Pull Request!

1. **Always** discuss your project first with an Issue!

   This prevents your precious time when the maintainer later decides to not include (aka later maintain) the contribution.

2. Clone the repository on GitHub into your personal space.
3. Develop your change
4. Create a Pull Request against `sharpbrick/poweredup:master` (or a `release-x.y` branch for hotfixes).
5. Have the discussion.
7. Pull Request is merged by maintainer.

# Filing Issues

- If you have a question, file an issue! (label as question)
- If you have an idea, file an issue!
- If you have a suggestion, file an issue!
- If you think it is a bug, do not forget the following information
  - Library Version
  - Which steps are needed to reproduce the bug
  - Code Example (from a blank project) which reproduce the bug
  - Environemnt (.NET Version, Operating System, ...)
